# Detailed Summary

## 1. Preparation

This section summarizes how to prepare for upcoming Cisco Data Center
Switching interviews:

-   Focus on L2/L3 switching fundamentals (MAC learning, CAM/TCAM, ARP,
    VLAN, STP, ECMP).
-   Understand packet forwarding pipeline (ingress → parsing → lookup →
    ACL/QoS → egress).
-   Refresh QoS concepts: classification (DSCP/802.1p), queueing,
    scheduling, policing.
-   Review ACL basics: L2/L3/L4 filtering, permit/deny logic, hardware
    enforcement.
-   Clarify control-plane vs data-plane: ARP, LLDP, ICMP handled on CPU;
    forwarding done on ASIC.
-   Refresh debugging skills (GDB, cross-compilers, stack traces,
    minimal reproduction).
-   Prepare short, crisp answers rather than deep multi-layer
    explanations.
-   Know L4 forwarding (5‑tuple hashing, NAT/PAT, firewalls, load
    balancers; not Nginx).
-   Traffic generator prep: Python/Scapy-based packet generation;
    internal simulation tools.
-   Salary expectation answer: flexible, rely on Cisco's competitive
    compensation.
-   Relocation answer: fully open and ready to relocate.
-   Questions to ask next rounds: role scope, interaction with ASIC
    teams, L2/L3 responsibilities.

## 2. Interview Summary

This section summarizes your actual screening interview:

-   Interviewer was non-technical and mainly verifying background fit.
-   You walked through your resume and clarified your 14+ years industry
    experience + PhD.
-   You answered questions on QoS, L3 forwarding, L4 forwarding, packet
    lifecycle.
-   Written answers were simple and correct; over-explanation was due to
    misinterpretation.
-   You clarified experience with ACLs, VLANs, WiMAX-based networks, and
    QoS design.
-   You confirmed familiarity with GDB and cross-compilation toolchains
    (PowerPC, ARM).
-   Interviewer admitted being unsure about firmware vs software scope
    and read the description.
-   The role appears to be L2/L3 switching software development (not
    firmware).
-   Traffic generator question answered using Scapy + internal
    simulators.
-   You asked about next steps and coding expectations; she confirmed
    manager round next.
-   Coding will not be heavy; mainly conceptual technical and
    experience-based.
-   She will speak with the hiring manager this week and update you
    toward the end of the week.
-   No red flags; strong likelihood you passed the screening.
