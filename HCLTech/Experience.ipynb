    "Yes. A concrete example is my work on ECU board bring-up and hardware validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed device drivers for CAN and LIN communication ICs and for current-control ICs such as VNF and L99. These devices are controlled over SPI, and the main challenge was validating current and voltage transitions across different operating modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented state-machine-based firmware to control mode transitions, and used oscilloscopes, signal analyzers, and multimeters to measure current, voltage, and timing behavior. Measurements were validated against expected thresholds and datasheet specifications to confirm correct hardware behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate this hardware testing, I developed Python-based test scripts using UDS diagnostics, which allowed ECU tests to be executed repeatedly and integrated into CI-based regression testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously at Honeywell Avionics, I applied a similar approach while developing and validating serial, Ethernet, and SMBus drivers, using TRACE32/UDE for firmware debugging and lab instruments for signal validation.\n",

    "In addition, I’ve used Scapy and packet-capture tools to generate and analyze Ethernet and TCP/IP traffic for accurate network measurement and validation as part of my research work.\n",

    "2) Can you walk me through your experience with serial and network protocols\n",
    "(Ethernet, I2C, USB, UART, or single-wire buses) and explain:\n",

    "What you built or implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "Which protocols you used\n",

    "When debugging serial protocols, I follow a **layered approach**: *validate physical signals first, then protocol timing and sequencing, and finally firmware logic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example is my work on a quad-LIN device driver, where the LIN IC interfaces with the MCU over SPI. During bring-up, I implemented SPI register access, configured PLL-based clocks, set baud rates, and initialized individual LIN channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "I validated communication using a PLIN peer and observed LIN waveforms and timing using an oscilloscope and LIN analyzer. Initially, LIN responses were missing due to a timing-sensitive initialization issue, which I identified by correlating SPI transactions with LIN waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, I debugged a receive issue where the LIN message was present on the bus, but a status flag was asserted late by the IC. By observing both LIN signals and SPI reads, I confirmed the issue was timing-related and fixed it by introducing the correct delay per the datasheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve used the same debugging approach in avionics projects, for example debugging an FPGA-based serial interface where I captured traffic with a logic analyzer, identified incorrect SMBus responses, and resolved it in coordination with the FPGA team.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured, signal-first approach has worked consistently for SPI, LIN, UART, I2C, and Ethernet-based systems."

    "\n",
    "In my current ECU work, I collect CAN, LIN, and current measurement data using PCAN / PLIN tools, SPI analyzers, and oscilloscopes. The raw traces are logged automatically and processed using Python scripts to detect transmission inconsistencies, timing violations, and abnormal signal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research work, I built a larger-scale data pipeline for Ethernet-based video streaming analysis. I captured packet traces using Wireshark and Python-based capture scripts, decoded protocol fields, and analyzed timing and throughput metrics using Pandas. The results were visualized using Matplotlib to validate bandwidth behavior and correlate it with video quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across both cases, my approach is consistent: automate data capture, analyze it programmatically, and present results in a way that supports engineering decisions, whether for hardware validation or system-level performance evaluation."

    "Code changes go through mandatory peer reviews, and as part of each PR I include Python-based regression tests that validate the new functionality and ensure existing behavior is not impacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tests are executed automatically using GitLab CI, and the results are attached directly to the PR, providing test evidence and visibility before any merge. Only after reviews and CI checks pass do we merge into the main branch.\n",

    "\n",
    "I worked on current-control ICs such as VNF and L99, where the L99 is a multi-channel device used for low-power subsystems. I designed a state-machine-based driver to manage transitions between normal, standby, and low-power modes, which is critical for validating ECU and battery-related behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firmware continuously monitors current, voltage, and timing constraints, ensuring state transitions occur within defined limits. To validate this, I used oscilloscopes, signal analyzers, and SPI traces to correlate firmware actions with physical measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This firmware directly enabled hardware validation, including thermal and environmental chamber testing, by providing deterministic control and measurable outputs that the hardware team could verify.\n",

    "Overall, my embedded work focuses on making ECU and power behavior observable, testable, and automatable, which is essential for reliable system validation."
